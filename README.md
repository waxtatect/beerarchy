## Beerarchy
### Prologue
Anarchy, chaos, griefing. All is allowed on this unmoderated server. Venture into the depths of hell or ascend the highest mountains, leaping from float land to float land all the way into space. You will be rewarded for your efforts, as endless riches can be found in the most inaccessible places. But be careful who you trust or you will lose everything and be forced to start all over.

So keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Hide your base well, conquer the lands, climb the rankings, become the number one and God of this world.

### Act One
You are approached by a dark figure. Something is amiss. It is not whole, missing an eye, radiating darkness. Its eye, shimmering in the starlight, stares straight into your being, burning your soul, turning your heart into brimstone and ashes, and with a voice of 6000 years old it starts to speak: "I offer you a choice: Live your boring life and achieve nothing, or be cast to Beerarchy to start over and get a chance to gain unfathomable riches and eternal fame. Rot away like a feeble cowardly dog, or defile the gods, conquer their thrones and become the lord master of these desolate lands."

You are blinded by the promise of countless bars of gold, endless amounts of diamonds and eternal supplies of mithril, blinded by the promise of immortality, everlasting glory and lordship over a world. You do not need to think about this decision. You make it. You grasp the opportunity with your greedy hands.

A you awaken, you find yourself in a scorching desert. There is nothing but sand and you are stripped of what little Earthly belongings you had. Recalling the dark figure's words, "Start over", "Get a chance", you realize all too well that such words should have been taken literally. There is no way back, but now you are more determined than ever. You clench your fists, ready to take on this world, and as you look at the Sun approaching the horizon, you discern some ungodly shapes slowly moving towards you ...

### Game Principles
* It's based on "vanilla Minetest": It looks and feels a lot like the out of the box default Minetest game, but it becomes more alien when you mine very deep or climb really high
* Offer a difficult and more challenging game: Food is severely limited by tweaking the noise parameters, decreasing the chance of animals spawning and even the apple tree schematic has been modified to produce fewer apples in order to achieve this goal
* Allow players to progress: This is done by means of a ranking system that gives players points for certain activities such as digging, building, traveling etc.
* Provide a tech tree: The tech tree requires players to mine, climb and explore in order to unlock new technologies such as small electronics, travelnets, basic machines and digtrons, but also such things as better armor for more dangerous realms
* Full use of horizontal and vertical space: Keep mining interesting by providing goals in the form of underworlds. Huge mountains and plenty of float lands to hide your base and be safe from other players
* Reward players but keep it hard: By mining deeper or climbing higher, players are rewarded by easier to get to minerals in larger and larger amounts but also face dangers such as death falls and more powerful mobs
* Let Beerarchy be a dangerous place: The seed was specifically selected for the desert spawn, but the places that offer more riches are more dangerous too and not just because of the mobs, but also because the terrain, caves and super high mountains are difficult to navigate safely
* This game is not meant for mobile or tablet

### Mods
#### Mod Highlights
* Nyan Cat!! Yes!!
* More ores: More ores tin is aliased to the Minetest game tin, mithril the most difficult to find and therefore obviously the strongest mineral
* Unified inventory, 3D armor, skins: Including of course mithril armor but also a spacesuit in order to travel in space without dying. Lots of skins, cleaned up to remove some of the nonsense, too small or invisible skins
* TNT and fire enabled, explosives mod: Burn it all, blow up stuff or booby trap your base!
* Mobs redo and various types of mobs, fishing: Animals, horses, monsters, horror, dmobs, dragons
* Customized basic machines, 3 levels of tech, GPS and fun tools: Small electronics and travelnets, the standard basic machines for material duplication and the powerful digtron units for even faster mining
* Treasurer: Including various TRMs and a custom one for this game's specific materials, minerals and items, a TSM to spawn chests in dungeons
* HUD and sprint: HUD bars for armor, hunger and exhaustion when you sprint. Additionally, hunger drops quicker when you sprint, jump or swim
* Bags: Very expensive but extremely important if you want to protect your items
* Chat modes and mail: Various chat options, muting other players and option to send mail to offline (or online of course) players
* Boost carts, updated boats and handholds for climbing: More lag friendly, build those roller coasters and endless railway systems and special climbing pick to work around the missing sneak jump and sneak ladder features (/glitches)
* Snowdrift and customized under_sky with additional skybox fixes: Rain and snow and proper darkness underground or in space
* Integral and underworlds: Explore huge trees or mine all the way to the deepest levels of hell, with one extra layer added to the underworlds, of which the depths have been tweaked as well
