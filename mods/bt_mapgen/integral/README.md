Integral Trees for Minetest

The main goal for this mod was to put integral trees (as in the novel by the same name) into Minetest, mostly because they look cool. However, it occurred to me that this was a good way to use some of that vast, untapped airspace without leaving too much shadow on the ground. So, I made them into explorable domains with dangers and rewards at least comparable to the underworld.

These integral trees are giant plants whose roots extend into a fourth physical dimension. Their roots can be found in the center of the visible body, and simultaneously buried in the ground below, without any tangible connection. They range in size from 300 meters to a kilometer tall. Seeing one in its entirety is quite a chore.

To get to a tree, you must first find one. (Not as easy as you might think, as they don't like to be crowded.) They're separated by about a kilometer from each other, hovering around 200 meters up. You could build a tower to reach them, or look for their roots, buried in the ground (and occasionally the air) nearby. Punch a root and you'll be teleported in the direction you punch, either to another root, about a kilometer away, or to the tree, if you punch upwards. How do you recognize the roots? Trust me, you'll know them if you see them.

Integral trees have peculiar wood, laced with minerals which can be extracted by cooking it. They are an excellent source of iron and diamond. However, they are also usually infested with giant arthropods which fiercely defend them against any intruder.

This mod requires the Mobs Redo package.
